# docker
I Play Docker here
Step 1 : added dockfile in your project, so docker engine can generate a dev env for this project
Step 2: push it into github, we are going to generate dev env in github repository
(why, so everyone can just get your project and your dev env,, they can run it if they have docker engine)
Step 3: use docker desktop, point to the git hub repository, start to build your dev env
